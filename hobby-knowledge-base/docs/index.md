# Welcome to hobby-knowledge-base

This is an example site. It is part of [StarfallProjects/obsidian-netlify-monorepo](https://github.com/StarfallProjects/obsidian-netlify-monorepo) - an example repo used to show how you can deploy multiple websites from one Obsidian vault, via GitHub and Netlify. For more information on the deployment, [refer to the tutorial](https://www.starfallprojects.co.uk/posts/obsidian-monorepo/). For information about the setup of this site, refer to the [README](https://github.com/StarfallProjects/obsidian-netlify-monorepo/tree/main/hobby-knowledge-base).

The other pages on this site are purely as an example. They contain brief descriptions of Balance Druid spells during the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.
