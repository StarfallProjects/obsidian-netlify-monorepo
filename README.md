# Example repo for a tutorial: Create multiple websites from one Obsidian vault

This is the example repo for my tutorial on creating multiple websites from one [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, using a [GitHub](https://github.com/) monorepo and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

* For information on the purpose of the project, and instructions on how to set up your own vault -> monorepo -> Netlify deployments, refer to [the tutorial on my website](https://www.starfallprojects.co.uk/posts/obsidian-monorepo/).
* For details about the individual sites, refer to the READMEs in [blog](https://github.com/StarfallProjects/obsidian-netlify-monorepo/tree/main/blog) and [hobby-knowledge-base](https://github.com/StarfallProjects/obsidian-netlify-monorepo/tree/main/hobby-knowledge-base).
